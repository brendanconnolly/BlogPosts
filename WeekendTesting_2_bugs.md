This weekend I had the opportunity to attend another session of [WeekendTesting](http://www.weekendtesting.com).

This session was a little different than the last session I attented on [Mobile Testing](http://brendanconnoly.net/weekend-testing-experience-report) since we weren't going to focus on testing software but instead on [Bug Rehab](http://weekendtesting.com/?p=4191). 

### Bug Report Rehab
The goal of the session was to look at existing bug reports and see how we might improve them and at the same take those lessons and implement them in future bug reports.

It's easy to think of testing as the art of finding bugs but thats often just the beginning. Sometimes finding an issue is the easy part, convincing people that the issue is real and warrants attention and resolution can be much more difficult. A poorly communicated issue is easier to dismiss, it can also damage your credibility with the managers and developers that will read the report.

### What is a Bug Report 
We started by discussing what a bug report actually is. Just the word bug can cause some developers to get defensive, and [Carol Brands](https://twitter.com/CSBrands) suggested thinking of bug reports as change requests. I think that puts both testers and developers in a better mindspace. We aren't placing blame, we are suggesting an alternative set of behaviors. 
 
bug announcing vs bug reporting
 
 As you might expect if you've logged or viewed a bug report the standard and often required, expected behavior,actual behavior and reporduction steps came up. There were also mentions of including the environment specifics (OS, Platform, etc.) to help clarify the issue. These are all generally good things and help set a factual foundation for the issue, but theres more to good bug reports... 
 
 ### Selling It 
 Well at least supporting your bug reports. Bugs are subjective, some are so obvious that they can't be ignored but thats not always the case. I suggested that testers need to advocate for resolution in their bug reports. I felt pretty proud of myself for this little tidbit of wisdom, but then [Michael Bolton](http://www.developsense.com) responds with testers need to advocate for an issues significance rather than just its resolution and that is just spot on. I meant something similar but that just wraps up the idea with a pretty little bow. It you prove and issue is significant, its much more likely to be addressed. 
 
 This really highlights some of the value of weekend testing, it's experiential. I could have read that line from Michael on his blog but I doubt it would resonate the same as it did in realtime conversation. There's a ton of experience in that skype session, and you get full access to all of it.
 
 Back to the bugs, [Michael Larsen](http://mkltesthead.com) also pointed out that all the factual data about your bug only matters if isn't rejected. This just hammers home the importance of showing the significance of the issue is just as important as the detailed reproduction steps and other fact. 
  
 ### Concrete Examples
After clarifying our ideas about what a bug report is we actually looked at some real world bug reports from the Mozilla Firefox bug database. For each bug report we discussed its overall quality and how it might be improved. It's a good exercise, and it highlights an interesting aspect of bug reports that I didn't immediately realize. It's not just testers that log bugs. In the case of the Firefox, anyone can log a bug. However, even on less public systems bugs may come from customer service teams, sales or product teams so you can see how widely the quality of bugs entered can vary. 

There had been talk of templatized bug reports throughout the session. 


#Wrapping things up

It is the second session I've attended, both have been part of the Americas group since the times fit nicely into my schedule but there are sessions for other regions/timezones.  I've actually been meaning to attend some of the other group sessions just to see

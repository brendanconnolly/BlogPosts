The basics
==============
1. test types
	- Black Box
	- White Box / Glass Box
	- Exploratory

2. Test Case Design
	- Boundary
	- Equivalance Partitioning
	- Security / Vulnerability
	- Mind Mapping	
	- What else...

3.  User Stories / Acceptance Criteria refinement
	- how do we answer these types of questions

4. Books /Blogs

5. Notes
blog as categories for exploring,test, automation and cycle/ rotate 

blog getting started in js series
improve typing


context driven 
exploratory
black box vs white box
pair or peek - understanding what the code is doing helps to test effetively 


[different post  pt2 mind maps, test docs and heuristics? ]



separate topic for writing good bug reports
general definitions and then concrete examples... lets not get caught up in specific definitions or prescriptive solutions to avoid getting trapped in word play contradictions

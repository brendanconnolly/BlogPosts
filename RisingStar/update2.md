Greetings Supporters, 

Going into January I believed I had the relatively straight-forward task of deciding how to position inclusive automation and Jupyter Notebooks. To determine who the audience would be and then build a strategy around how to communicate value to them. 

I thought this would be a relatively straight forward task. That maybe with a few nuggets of advice I'd be on my way. 

As I reflected on the topic, exchanged messages and had conversations with some of you its become increasingly clear that the dynamics and relationships between testing, automation and management are complex and nuanced. While at the same time the currently accepted solutions and practices are expected or percieved to be simple and straightforward.

What I have come to see is that more foundational work is neccessary to give the concept legs to stand on. This means taking some time to research and refine, because through talking and attempting to write up my ideas I'm finding things are not as clearly defined as they need to be. 


In terms of *Tooling / Technology* I made solid progress on using Docker to simplify the setup of using Selenium inside of Jupyter Notebooks. It's looking like I have the a basic pattern I can follow to have language support for Ruby, Java, JavaScript and C#. Docker adds a layer of complexity, but it drastically improves the setup experience, reducing the barriers to entry. 

Still work to be done in terms of building example tests and notebooks across the languages but it feels like good progress is being made. In the video this month I have a demo of Java being used in the notebooks which I believe is a big step. In addition to it being a very popular language, its a staticly typed compiled language, an are that people may not expect notebooks to work in. 

I also did a webinar speaking about the automation maturity model described in my RisingStar submission. I spent some time talking about this inclusive automation and Jupyter Notebooks and the on going efforts and support this year. If you are interested the recording is available at [Beaufort Fairmont Webinars](https://beaufortfairmont.com/webinars/). I hope to be able to more of things like this over the coming year to try and draw attention and focus to the concept/project.

I also want to say thank you to those that have reached out and responded to me. It has been very helpful. I also apologize as it takes me longer to respond than I would like at times. Some of these first months seem to be about finding a rhythm to this, balancing the planning and coordinating with the doing. 

It's been a challenging and exciting month, I sincerely appreciate your time and support and look forward to continuing to work with you. 

In the coming month, I am targeting investigation/research/effort on:

### Test Automation Patterns
- What patterns exist
- Their relationship to inclusive automation and Jupyter Notebooks
- Potential for new patterns

### Roles in Automation: 
- Creators, Executors, Consumers of automation
- The associatied Responsibilities and Expectations of those roles

### Supporting Content for Inclusive Automation
- Models -> Building on the Quality Cathedral concept
- Strategy
- Concrete Examples 

### JavaScript Notebooks
- I'm excited about JS and it's another popular language to demonstrate. 

Best, 

B.

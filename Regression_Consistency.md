## Consistency Over Correctness

### Why does Consistency matter?
Consistent software behavior is what keeps our customers comfortable. Think of it like renting a car, you know how to drive, but the moment you step into that rental you immediately start trying to acclimate yourself to a sea of changes compared to your own car. The process can be frustrating, but at least its expected. 

When your software changes, your customers go through that same process. Instead of it being expected like when stepping into a rental car, it's their daily driver. 

If this change is by design it's explicit and intentionally included so it should be covered in regular feature testing not caught in a regression sweep.  

### Example changing a hotkey to follow a convention. 

### While feature testing this is benchmark is design/ convention / specification

### While regression testing the benchmark is production

changes in consistency will result in customer questions

regression is about evaluating/ investigating unintended changes to current behavior.


### Example change in financial calculation


Changes in consistency require more than just verification. Customer expections need to be managed.

## Level 3: Testing SDK
 Separate libraries/packages, consumable outside of tests and multiple consumers. Mixing automation and manual testing. Open source potential.



### Where Does Value Accrue
How would you value your Automation Framework if you had to delete half your tests. Could you still justify the level of investment you've put in?

Every test you delete gives you pause because what is the alternative. Its a binary viewpoint automated or manual. All of your value comes from the volume of tests and their reliability. 

Are you comfortable with that? Its a 1 trick pony, a consultant with 1 client. Every failing test, every unmaintained/unexercised corner of your framework is a liability to the overall value of your solution. This is a big reason why automation fails, its not set it and for get it unless your app is. If all of your tests aren't running all of the time its like brushing only some of your teeth. That little bit of decay over time erodes trust in your test suite as a whole. A few bad tests, some failures some flakiness

### Inclusive Automation


 Quality
Your customers probably don't really care about your test coverage. What they care about is your quality coverage. 
build things that support our application and our testers, build things that support quality. Quality 





### Platform focused

 level 2 is a platform for tests, level 3 is a platform for testing. 

We call them frameworks but we are tailor building a solution for 1 specific purpose. There may be a lot of tests, but all the effort we pour into the framework is geared for one thing, automated tests. 



test beat - pattern of testing  accrue vs execute tests accrue in the planning / early dev because have test ideas but can't execute them
execute accrue graph have more than you can execute or need 
rate of can add vs can run  0, 1
steep line down to test that you can run  morore tests than can be executed 
running tests in the beginning creasting not running 




### Increased Flexibility
We can do more things
Testing isn't a binary decision

Rather than a massive monument to automated tests

We turned our attention to building effective supports for quality

### Relieves Pain
With these supports we can Serve More People, Solve More Problems, 
We tried to automate the pain away, as we mature we aim to remove the automation pain

### Bundles of Joy
Rather than add 
#### Joy for Testers
We have a tool box at our finger tips to help you test more effectively. 
You know all that fancy data setup code, heres an script, app, chatbot to help you setup your exploration
You know all those external integrations that are a pain to log in into and you forget because its hard. Well guess what they have an api and heres a tool to fetch that data for you.

#### Joy for Automators

That api client your wrote, now thats its not locked into your proprietary private framework maybe you can open source the project. 
When hack-a-thon time comes around you have set of tools at your disposal to create something that can imporve testers lives while reducing cost and increasing the returns on the automation investment.


### Raises Consciousness
Successful automation requires an engaged audience. People need to feel its value.  The more ways people can consume it the more opportunity they have to engage with it. Engagemnet can 
Consume=> Engage => Contribute => Evangelize
Automation will flourish  

### Reduced Anxiety
#### Inclusive Automation

Automation is generally an exclusionary activity. We exclude tests that don't fit the mold. We exclude external integrations, We exclude people that can't code, and we exclude testers. 

At some point we interalized that testing is some kind of illness, and with the right tool you can find the cure. We can choose to perpetuate this in our automation, or we can build a platform for quality. We don't lose anything but we have so much to gain. 




to move on from this level we need to reframe automation

Whats it like working with someone that can only do things one way

up til level 2 abstraction is increasing from a 1 to 1 on a users actions to a machine approximate interpretation of the intent of the user. 
The user or customer is also abstracted further and further from the test. They are the human casualties of the requirements for speed and efficiency required to justify the level of cost and effort behind automation. 

I challenge you that as you get deeper into level 2 that if you don't progress into level 3 at some level you are automating to make yourselves feel good. Like at what point is enough really enough, you ever notice how teams brag about the number of tests they have. Or the lengths they have had to build out infrastructure to support their automation prowess. Its cool and a I'm happy for you but what I often don't see or hear is the concrete benefit to your customers. You might get stories about how happy management was with the project, I think almost out of surprise since so often these endevors go ary. 

And yes I acknowledge there are cases that might warrant this level of automated testing, but I also think this is kind of like software teams mimicking what netflix, amazon or google are doing. Chances are you aren't at the scale of google, netflix or amazon chances are you are over engineering and over optimizing.

## Level 0: Tests exist but framework does not.



### Problems Being Solved

At this level we are looking for a solution to replace tasks with something other than a person, usually code whether that takes the shape of tests, scripts, or a tool.

We are taking stuff applying code or tools to try and make it faster, easier or generally less painful. Generally at the individual level. Even if your team has adopted a tool or had it thrust upon you, each individual on that team is probably imposing their individual responsibilities upon the tool or code. That is they are representing or attempting to represent a 1 to 1 replica of what they did manually. 

Regression takes too long, everyone hates it management, testers just everyone. So to help we bought some liceneses and would like everyone to go through the training and automate their portion of regression. And as a result "stuff" gets automated. 


### Whats the issue here?

We shouldn't be so quick to judge teams with this level. These may not be the most efficient, uniform, maintainable or even scalable set of tests but they are often high value and impact for the people that wrote them. If they can manage to maintain them the could be really helpful.

At some point we all started here, faced with a problem we worked out a solution and used the tools available to us the best we could figure out at the time. 

The problem isn't so much that these tests or scripts exist, its the decisions immediately before and following this stage that are so rife with problems. (motivations behind tool choice, expectations about what tool can do)

## Tool Focused
At its root this level is usually driven by some tool or technology. Someone has recognized a problem and is going searching for something to help ease that pain. Someone then found, read about or was sold on just the tool for the job.

Selenium is a pretty standard choice at this point if your app is web based, but for other platforms or as cypress or the new crop of ai supported options come to market picking a solution can be contentious. Often as contentious as the actual tool choice is who is making that choice. 

### A childs enthusiasm... 
Tools are fun and intesting. The opportunity to play with a new toy and show a proof of concept of how this new thing will be helpful to your team is exciting. You get a platform to show your ingenuity and insight and you think if this goes well I could land that promotion. 

It's like being a kid in the candy store, its all delicious and the possibilities are endless. When you think of that metaphor whos the kid in the candy store? It's you right, it's not someone else on the team and its certainly not someone like your manager. 

If you aren't the kind in the candy store, it is not fun knowing someone else is going in. No matter what you know someone is coming out all sugared up ready to conquer the world and you probably have a situation or pile of new work to deal with.

And did you ever pause to question the motivations of the person running the candy store. 

### The Automation New Years Resolution

I'm going to get up early every day and have my tests automated by the end of the sprint. It's going to be different this time. 

### Hope & Magic & Cavities
It's not that this can't work, being tool or technology centric like this means we have some expectation that this tool will be the solution to our problem.

## Common over Complete

Even when dealing feature testing we are confronted with the [*Impossibility Of Complete Testing*](http://www.testingeducation.org/BBST/foundations/Kaner_impossibility.pdf). If we can't hope to completely test everything when first implementing new functionality then we certainly don't have bandwidth during regression testing. 

If we accept this reality then regression testing can only hope to cover a fraction of the functional feature testing. While this may be understandable to testers it may cause some managers and stake holders to be uncomfortable. If we aren't testing everything then it is very important to be able to clearly elucidate our actions and their motivations.

If not complete then what? When feature testing attention the focus is on mitigating risk. Testers use tools like boundary conditions and equivalence partitioning to try to increase coverage while minimizing number of test cases required.

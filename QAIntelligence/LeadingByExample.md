Testers, even when embedded on teams are outsiders.  Their value is derived from, maintained by, and continually put at risk this status.

In the early days of software development there was a sense of sanctity around testing, testers were housed on separate teams, segregated in different organizational hierarchies in order to avoid the corrupting influence of developers. A testers vision was pure, the systems under test were black boxes to which testers could apply input and make judgments upon the outputs. While the intent was to remain unbiased advocates for quality,the tides turned adversarial and bureaucratic. As agile methodologies arose and more popularly accepted there was little place for dedicated outsiders proxying for customer feedback.

Large dedicated testing teams gave way to test or quality specialists embedded on smaller teams.  While the relationships have improved, outsider status remains. A testers value is not desribed by a set of tangible or measurable skills, it is linked to their unique *mindset*. The wielder of this mindset takes on mystic or supernatural qualities. Imbued with a unique world view that grants insight into circumstances and actions that when executed can expose critical issues or vulnerabilities in software. 

A testers value is now measured by how differently they think than the rest of their team. Their true skills and influence are easier to dismiss since their benefit is attributed to the intangible. A token offering to the quality gods. 

## Methodologies & Frameworks

Companies and individuals have placed a great deal of effort into creating and standardizing development practices. This provides a shared vocabulary for explaining and understanding. Teams can use that shared vocabulary to effectively communicate ideas and progress. There just isnâ€™t a common framework for how testing is integrated onto teams. 


## Influence Through Alignment

If people don't really know what you do, how you do it, or how to talk about it how successful can you be? 

Just like development, testers need common practices and vocabulary to be able to communicate their intents and actions easily. The problem is that testing does not carry the weight and influence to support organizations and teams adopting whole new processes and terminology. 

It's not a slight to testing, testing simply isn't the dominant role or activity on a software team. This means testing practices and vocabulary need to align with accepted development standards, processes and terms. Additional semantics and processes only serve to invoke the historical baggage of testing as a bureaucratic and costly process.

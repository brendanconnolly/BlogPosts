Testing isn't dead but it doesn't mean we can't dig into it to better understand it.

### What is Testing
We broke up into groups to define / draw out what exactly we though testing looked like. Our group started out by creating a list of our thoughts. Later we found out we might be sharing/presenting our results to the other groups so I tried to capture our list into a [sketchnote](http://royanlee.com/?p=4414) style mind map. 

I've never actually done any sketchnoting before but since I was already in a new place in a room full of strangers why not try something else new...

It was done in a bit of a rush so I'm not sure I got all our thoughts in (I probably didn't). I also ran out of sketch ideas after a bit, looking at it now I wish I turned the *exposer* box into a towel and had a person behind it. In any case I liked sketchnoting and plan to dig into it a little more.

### What is a Problem?


### Coding System

### Testing and Observation

recording leads to teh question of transcription. Verblization as a means of recognizing ones own actions.
I'm pretty sure most testing wuld look very random --> is this why others stuggle to understand its value

### Introspection & Self Awareness

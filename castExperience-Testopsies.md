Testing isn't dead but it doesn't mean we can't dig into it to better understand it.

### What is Testing
We broke up into groups to define / draw out what exactly we though testing looked like. Our group started out by creating a list of our thoughts. Later we found out we might be sharing/presenting our results to the other groups so I tried to capture our list into a [sketchnote](http://royanlee.com/?p=4414) style mind map. 

I've never actually done any sketchnoting before but since I was already in a new place in a room full of strangers why not try something else new...

It was done in a bit of a rush so I'm not sure I got all our thoughts in (I probably didn't). I also ran out of sketch ideas after a bit, looking at it now I wish I turned the *exposer* box into a towel and had a person behind it. In any case I liked sketchnoting and plan to dig into it a little more.

### What is a Problem?
Testing is about identifying things, risks, bugs or more generally problems. Let's not get caught up in pedantic definitions, the value here isn't in the result it's the process. Can you verbally express without resorting to vague platitudes, truisms what is a pillar of your role as a tester? 

This is important because it directly effects the strength of another testing pillar, reporting problems. [Translating](http://www.brendanconnolly.net/testers-translators/) the tacit into explicit is a direct reflection on the value of a tester
We can all recognize what a problem feels like but without being able to express it we accept the risk of shallow agreement which often leads to mismatched expectations. A tester needs a clear understanding of what a problem is in their context in order to effectively relay their findings to stakeholders. 

### Coding System

Next we dug a little deeper into our testing process to come up with a list of different activities and aspects of testing with the goal of quantifying them into recognizable categories. 

It's a surprisingly interesting exercise, to paraphrase Michael Bolton:

>Do something (perhaps naively) with intention to recognize patterns
become aware of them name them and make explicit.

The group I was in chose to model our coding system after the scientific method. I'm a big fan or wrapping testing processes in terms and methods that are already accepted or in practice by non-testing groups.

Once you understand and recognize what you are actually doing when you are testing it offers you perspective. 

For each category of action you can now examine their value and impact. 
- Do we need to do it? 
- Should we avoid it? 
- Do we like it?

Then based on the answers to your questions you close the loop with intentionality.

### Testing and Observation

Armed with the coding system we broke up into pairs with one person as tester and the other person acting as observer. To further aide in observation Michael suggested recording the testing with a screen recorder. 

![Group Working with Michael Bolton](http://www.brendanconnolly.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cast2016TestopsyGroup.jpeg)

I was surprised to find that recording testing sessions was not an entirely uncommon practice amongst the group. Observation and recording leads to the question of narration / transcription. As you might expect, just viewing a testers actions does not capture with fidelity all that is going on.

#### Verbalization
I'm pretty sure most testing would look very random --> is this why others stuggle to understand its value


#### Coverage

 > Coverage is how much you know about something and how well we know it, quality is what you know about it

 Coverage needs to be relayed as a composite measure that relates to the different dimensions of the product and the environment in which it is being tested. To be able to have a meaningful discussion on coverage, what coverage generally constitutes needs to be agreed upon before we can accurately discuss or summarize it. 

#### Tempo

As we all took turns testing it was pretty common for the person testing to just jump into testing. The result is a hybrid bug hunt and ad-hoc learning session. This isn't a slight at those testers, it's my first inclination to poke at the app, see how it responds, learning as I go. What Michael helped clarify here was that this approach leads to generally superficial testing which in turn will most likely turn up superfiical bugs. 

 > Every bug takes away from our coverage

It's validating to find bugs, 

 Shift from testing to learn to testing to find

before diving in, stop establish charter for what you are going to do.

### Introspection, Intent & Self Awareness

without an explicit mission implicit missions take over 

consider reforming the charter to match what was actually was covered

Requirements are developed.

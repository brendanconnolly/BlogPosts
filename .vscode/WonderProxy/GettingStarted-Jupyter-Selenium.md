## What are Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter Notebooks are web based documents that blend together [markdown](), code that can be executed on the fly as well as visual output of that codes results.  

They have gained immense popularity in data science and academia. The code to manipulate data can live side by side with the resulting visualization and an explanation for how it should be interpreted. What makes it even more powerful code is editable and executable in real time by the viewer, so the full story of the code can come to life right in front of their eyes.

Each notebook is created targeting a specific language kernel,

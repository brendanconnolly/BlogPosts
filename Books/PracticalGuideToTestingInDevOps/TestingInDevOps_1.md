When deciding to read [A Practical Guide To Testing in Devops]() by [Katrina Clokie]() for [#30DaysOfTesting](). I wanted to focus on avoiding the temptation to get destination oriented and just finish the book. In the vein of [Testopsies]() (a concept I learned about at from [Michael Bolton]() at CAST2016), I wanted to give time for both inspection and introspection. 

To that end, the plan I arrived at was:
1. Read the book start to finish
2. Divide the book into 3 parts
3. Read each part twice (repeating before moving on)

## In the Beginning

The book sets the stage by describing how testing has transitioned as software development practices have evolved from waterfall to agile and further into *devops*.

> In waterfall, testers have sole ownership of test strategy and execution. There is comfort in knowing that testing as an activity belongs to us. Testing is our role and our identity in the team

The ownership of testing acting as a means of identity really resonated with me. While it was an unhealthy and unreasonable expectation for testers own quality, it was a mantle I tried to uphold with pride. In the face of hopeless odds I was doing my bit for my customers. 


> Agile Challenges our definition of testing and its ownership

> DevOps pushes testing outwards
expanding and enabling testing in production. Production is no longer reserved for fully formed features, production becomes a shared workplace for customers and engineers. Shipping doesn't mean done, it just means ready to evaluate in the realm of our customers. feature flags isolate changes...

Developers can't punt code over the wall because they now have  direct line of visibility and responsibility to customers. Testers don't need to be quality cops, we act as a service to developers, since developers own supporting features as much as creating them. Testers are no longer shackled to quality through testing.

Expect the practicioner to be alert,motivated and capable of judgement

Galactic modeling language

there is a difference between wandering at random and real exploring 

without direction or purpose... you'll be lost

### Chapter 1
recognize a risk and turn that into a question to be answered

we always find the most serious bugs when we go off script

we still found surprises when we deviated from the scripts

checking that software meets expectations and exploring for risk

exploratory testing requires that your brain be fully engaged at all times

me: automating is an act of exploration

state diagram?

me: plan out charter as series of notebook scenarios like a guided tour
expedition party members - guide, notetaker/academic, technical resources (captain)

you notice what kinds of conditions the software does not handle well and use that knowlege to push even harder

me: jon bach talk about sessions integrated with automation. microsessions?
expedition -> experiment. learnings from session distilled into fruitful repetitive experiments. Building a guidebook for future testing / Demonstrable Debrief

Brainstorm a list of questions. Consider how the current test strategy answers each question. 
me: automated tests answer some question, what you do with the results is more important than the act of executing them. Automate enough to inform decisions, they are a diagnostic tool. The tool doesn't replace the doctor

### chapter 2
Different charters, different types of exploration
me: different charters different diagnostic tools. What about cross cutting concerns, base charter characteristics

me: charters for person/scenario  explore X persona with Y team dynamics to discover possible positive contributions 

a good charter is a prompt it suggests sources of inspiration without dictating precise actions or outcomes

exploring can reveal opportunities to add new requirements as well as risks or problems

when you recognize an implicit expectation that deserves exploration, capture it as a charter.

you don't want to spend a lot of time discovering information that no one will take action on





chapter 9

trust boundaries - a place where your software connects to other software that it cannot assume will always play by the rules, such as a nother system, one th

[me] we carve these areas out of automation when possible not because there is not value but because they are difficult and/or challenging




inclusive automation- engages the tester while they are testing. offering assistance or enabling greater focus on the testing at hand

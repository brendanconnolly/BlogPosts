This one is a bit of a classic, it pops up in interviews for a variety of positions even those outside of testing. 
So how **DO** you test a pen? Or I suppose in its usual context the emphasis is usually, how do **YOU** test a pen? 

When I first heard it posed to someone I laughed, I knew the hiring manager and thought is this guy just literally looking at his desk and asking random questions? I can only imagine how unexpected it might seem to the person actually being asked. 

The trick with all these test this arbitrary item questions is their subtle complexity. The first step is really getting past the curveball nature of the question. Then just dive in and let the ideas flow. This is where using a [Mind Map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map) is super helpful. If you haven't tried them, I really encourage you to do so, the process is less linear than using a list so it is a closer match to the human thought process.

### The Obvious

My first inclination when you give me a pen is to squiggle circles to paper to see if it works. So lets examine that process a little closer. That tactile experience is much richer, it provides much more information about the pen than the binary response to does it work. You get a sense for how it feels to use the pen, and you are already making decisions about it. Do you like it? Is it nice to write with? Is it cheap and disposable, a status symbol like a [Mont Blanc]()? 

We can't skip the obvious and jump to the complex and extraordinary conditions you may want to test. 

### Types

Pens come in all kinds of shapes and sizes. Some are disposable and some are reusable or even gift worthy. In each of these cases the pen must match the consumers expectations. A pen might look nice but if it doesn't write well I am going to think its a cheap knock off. If the pen is just an everyday disposable, I really only expect that it will work and not leak profusely.

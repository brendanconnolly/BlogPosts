Some time ago I read a blog post by Scott Hanselman called [Dark Matter Developers: The Unseen 99%](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/DarkMatterDevelopersTheUnseen99.aspx). The idea being that the bulk of the developers are people that: 

> They don't read a lot of blogs, they never write blogs, they don't go to user groups, they don't tweet or facebook, and you don't often see them at large conferences.

This resonated with me, and since then I have felt and heard similar sentiments echoed about testers out there in the world.

### Passion vs. Cargo Cult

>Point is, we need to find a balance between those of us online yelling and tweeting and pushing towards the Next Big Thing and those that are unseen and patient and focused on the business problem at hand.

### It's Ok
>The Dark Matter Developer will never read this blog post because they are getting work done using tech from ten years ago and that's totally OK. I know they are there and I will to support them in their work.

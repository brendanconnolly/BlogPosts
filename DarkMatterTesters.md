Some time ago I read a blog post by Scott Hanselman called [Dark Matter Developers: The Unseen 99%](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/DarkMatterDevelopersTheUnseen99.aspx). The idea being that the bulk of the developers are people that: 

> They don't read a lot of blogs, they never write blogs, they don't go to user groups, they don't tweet or facebook, and you don't often see them at large conferences.

This resonated with me, and since then I have felt and heard similar sentiments echoed about testers out there in the world.

### Passion vs. Cargo Cult

>Point is, we need to find a balance between those of us online yelling and tweeting and pushing towards the Next Big Thing and those that are unseen and patient and focused on the business problem at hand.

### It's Ok
Proselytizing about engaging in the community feels good, in so many ways that engagement can make you better at your job so it's only natural to want to share it. The thing is that isn't the only route to churning out good work, not engaging outside of work hours doesn't make a bad tester nor does getting involved mean you are a good tester. 



>The Dark Matter Developer will never read this blog post because they are getting work done using tech from ten years ago and that's totally OK. I know they are there and I will to support them in their work.

### So what do we do?

We bring that knowledge in. *How* and *why* you learned something isn't that important, focus on sharing *what* you learned and showcasing the impact it has had on your performance and possibly your organization. If people get curious where all your insight and information is coming from that is your time to plant a passion seed and share your resources. 

If what you are doing is working, it's only natural that people will get curious. Once there is some healthy curiosity consider talking to your organization about incentivizing or sponsoring opportunities for community engagement.

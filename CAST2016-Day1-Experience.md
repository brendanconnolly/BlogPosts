### Intro

Heavy on "confer" time available to interact and question 

### Keynote - Nicholas Carr

#Automation Complacency
    We lose situational awareness
    Automation changes how we approach problems, we develop a reliance upon it and build a false trust in it
#Automation Bias
    Automation has an agenda implicit or explicit 
- Alert Fatigue -->higher likilhood to ignore
Automation does question things, people
overriding instincts
mindless execution
the may steal from peoples abiltiy to develop deep skills
ownership of learning provides higher results over memorization / rote execution 
    - the generation effect
    - the de-generation effect -no challenge no growth
are a select few becoming zookeepers / animal trainers for constraining computer/ automation, the rest of the population at risk of animal attack / service animal reliance

expert human beings act as feedback loop to provide insight for automation.

#Automation Paradox
yerkes- dodson curve
human centered automation --> benefits of computer while continuing to grow people via challenge
over automation leads to skill decay
automation after mastery
when automation is introduced matters, too soon in skills curve you handicap future progress of human resources
automation should cede control to humans periodically to avoid Complacency
human process should occur before  automated review. Automation limits scope, human response post automation is further limited by scope generated by machines
automation to supplement to not to supplant

### Quality form the Ground up
Quality goes beyond testing
Bubbles - in a vacuum in a silo
separate systems = separate thinking
if you are searching for a unicorn consider having other teams inform the search to avoid a donkey in a costume. 
impossibly loyal to our customers
fake features to get test debt removed.
Bring other teams and customers along for the journey. Avoiding frustration of changes -->encouraging engagement.
Collaborating over design and prioritization ux/dev/test
Evangelize project across teams, inviting other teams to a demo of what is being done outside your Bubbles
go pop some Bubbles
be embassadors of quality, other groups judge quality, its not just passing tests


when automation creates an isolating bubble, testers engage.

embrace your ability to impact change.

- Adding analytics into the product --> can we analyze/summarize  audit logs?

### Test Management Revisited
its right for us to question the role of test management
Shift test management to test leadership --> we need a voice at the table
Managers promote stability leaders press for change - John p Kotter
define what it means to be a tester at your organization
leadership starts with vision
every tester is a lead even without title aspire for confidence, responsibility and courage
when we embed even if we do other things we need to keep testing. Its how we recognize risk.
looking at the horizon for potential issues, then making data visible to dev to drive change

people will make discussions you don't agree with and that has to be ok.

consumer driven contract tests

you don't need a solution but you do need to give people the runway to solve problems


### Agile Requirements Exploration w Janet Gregory

Discover to deliver
we focus on stories but can lose the broader narrative
Testing dimensions may overlap but they avoid hidden questions
Build personas and use them in your test charters. Explore with X personas

I always model part of my testing as the A$$hole hacker 
process modeling to define testable scenarios

Example Mapping Matt Wynne
Examples are transport between test language and business language -->is this really what you want?


prioritize business rules --> may help clarify stories



### Keynote Sal Freudenberg

Tacit knowledge--> stuff we have lost teh source code for but keep using but don't remember how the information appeared.

4 stages of creativity 
- preparation 
- incubation
    let our mind meander around the subject. 
- illumination
    incubation feeds later idea creation, like after a run or shower

- verification

theres more to sharing than talking, diversity requires supporting different information processing needs

rather than cure or suppress, embrace neuro diversity.

### Lessons learned in Implementing Exploratory Testing -- Nancy Kelln

who could actually handle this, not everyone is wired this way
pockets to put this, not necessarily full-scale adoption 

we don't make the ship decision. 
build small let victories pave the way for embracing change
test strategies, regression in mind maps, some get it some don't. People need choice
traditional approaches give illusions of safety and security
exploratory style introduces uncertainty.Oh my god these people think I'm a total idiot. Exploratory testing is very transparent but can strike panic in highly structured environment.  

the sustainability problems

fear squishes innovation encouraging reversion, change that solves problems sticks.  


the learning felt different from women -- what was it about it

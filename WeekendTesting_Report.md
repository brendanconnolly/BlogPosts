Mobile app testing

I first heard of Weekend Testing several years ago, I meant to get involved then but just never made the time. Enter the [CAST 2015](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQB4l9iafcel0y8h5HrfChOg4HxjLOX31) live stream and the [keynote](http://youtu.be/vOfjkkblFoA) by
[Ajay Balamurugadas](http://enjoytesting.blogspot.com/) where there was a call to action to engage and contribute to the community. I hadn't realized there was such a strong community of testers, and I wanted to be a part of it. I wanted to learn and grow, and a community of testers sounded so exciting.

The topic for the session was [Mobile Test Design for Non-Functional Tests](http://weekendtesting.com/?p=4156). If I wasn't excited before the topic sounded great. I work on a small team, and we do not have any mobile applications. I wouldn't have any real opportunity for directed hands on testing with out something like Weekend Testing. 

It was with a mix of excitement and nervousness that I joined the skype session...  

After introductions we begain with
### What do you notice thats different when app is mobile that a Tester would care about


The discussion started with the level of access an app requires on the device. When I first opened the Weather Channel app I was confronted with a prompt asking for me to allow the app to access my location even when the app is not in use. 

Next were considerations of touch and ease of use. 

Followed by discussion and issues with localization. 

One of the hardest parts of this testing session was the sheer volume of information that the app presents the user with. 

### Easy to Use, Easy to Learn, Matches Expectations
 
 
### Ads

### Impact on Device


### Comparison and Evaluation


### Testability and a Test 

### We're Testing Relationships

### Take Aways and Suggestions





The focus of the session was Test Design for non functional requirements
state of the device is a consideration for the app. additional heat from heavy load in addition to heat generated by charging. 

Device state for battery- app can reduce load/ info displayed to increase life
same could be said for state of connectivity

ad space, should this app have ads? If so what is the relationship to content
 who is the audience and what are the looking for 
 
Bolton That is:  we're not "testing the software".  We're testing relationships between software, hardware, people, and the interactions between all of those things.

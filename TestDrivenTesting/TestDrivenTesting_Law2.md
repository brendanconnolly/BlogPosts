The first law of [Test Driven Testing]() challenges a tester to not begin testing until they have a conscientious outcome in mind. Clarity of intent, is not a guarantee that the work we are trying to accomplish isn't overly ambitious.

The second of the [three simple laws of TDD](http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/The_Three_Laws_of_Test-Driven_Development) helps to keep the developer inside a tight feedback loop. 

>2. You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures.

TDD is a discipline that on the individual developer level is a microcosm of the transition from waterfall to agile process.  We don't want to let what we think we already know drive our actions. We don't dive into attempting to solve complex problems. We want to work small and iterate, letting the feedback cycle propel us forward. 

## Narrowly Focused Intentions

### A Bugs Life
When you sit down and want to start testing, what happens the moment you think you might have a bug on your hands? Do you dig in? Iterate over the same scenario trying to nail down the reproduction steps? 

Sometimes the bugs you find feel like [merit badges]() testers get to wear around. Medals of honor that represent the value that a tester brought to the team. 

In reality bugs are a distraction, wouldn't you rather have be objectively evaluating software on its merits rather than its flaws? Outside of the time sink for other team members prioritizing and resolving bugs, the impact on a tester is severe. Testers cycle through the discovery process, then begin defining the bug through reproduction steps. Next might be refining the reproduction steps, the investigation of related areas to get a sense of scope and impact. Then we transition to the reporting process, logging and communicating possibly even defending the bug.

### Functionally Focused
It's not just bugs though, there many dimensions to testing. That feature that has different roles or personas associated with it. It might seem faster to address all the functionality at once, switching accounts as you step through. Maybe you start peek at some other minor changes while you are testing a moderately related change. 

It might seem like no big deal, but it's a distraction. Distractions, even small ones add up and add friction to work. Friction slows throughput.That bug you thought you saw, it'll still be there once you wrap up your current objective. Tackle those related tasks in series rather than attempting to do it in parralel. Speed doesn't have to be measured in how fast we do multiple things, let your speed via throughput.

## Second Law of Test Driven Testing 
> 1. Test only enough to satisfy the objective

## Joy comes in sips, not gulps 
### \- Sharon Draper

People tend to gulp things when they are in a rush or aren't in a position to savor something. Time is a precious resource, and while testers need to be mindful of time spent testing, it shouldn't be an activity approached from a mindset of scarcity. Rather than rush, sip your way through testing. 

Think about when you have a really good cup of coffee, wine or whiskey. While you are waiting for it, you start building it up the experience in your mind. When it arrives you hold the cup or glass in your hands, before you bring it to your lips you are anticipating it's qualities, how it will taste, how it will make you feel. 
 
You don't gulp the good stuff, you sip and revel in it. Sips are iterations, its the same beverage but in each sip you are searching, looking to find out more. Did you catch a note of something, yum better take another to be sure. 
 
Make your objectives sips. Sipping introduces a pause, which according to [Michael Bolton](http://www.developsense.com/blog/2014/01/the-pause/) provides:
> a little breathing space in which questions oriented towards critical thinking have time to come to mind. 

Stay focused on your objective and savor it. Let each objective breathe, if you notice some behavior of interest take note and move on. 

## Deep Work

We want to drive our efforts to breaking down work into chunks that we can accomplish inside a distraction free time-box. The more we can structure testing efforts using effective [time management](http://www.brendanconnolly.net/a-time-for-test/)the greater insight and productivity you can expect.

> To produce at your peak level you need to work for extended periods with full concentration on a single task free from distraction.

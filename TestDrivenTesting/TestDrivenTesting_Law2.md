The second of the [three simple laws of TDD](http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/The_Three_Laws_of_Test-Driven_Development) helps to keep kepp a narrow scope of work.

>2. You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures.


## Staying True to Intent


## Second Law of Test Driven Testing 
> 1. Test only enough to satisfy the objective

## Joy comes in sips, not gulps 
>\- Sharon Draper

People tend to gulp things when they are in a rush or aren't in a position to savor something. Time is a precious resource, and while testers need to be mindful of time spent testing, it shouldn't be an activity approached from a mindset of scarcity. Rather than rush, sip your way through testing. 

Think about when you have a really good cup of coffee, wine or whiskey. While you are waiting for it, you start building it up the experience in your mind. When it arrives you hold the cup or glass in your hands, before you bring it to your lips you are anticipating it's qualities, how it will taste, how it will make you feel. 
 
You don't gulp the good stuff, you sip and revel in it. Sips are iterations, its the same beverage but in each sip you are searching, looking to find out more. Did you catch a note of something, yum better take another to be sure. 
 
Make your objectives sips. Sipping introduces a pause, which according to [Michael Bolton](http://www.developsense.com/blog/2014/01/the-pause/) provides:
> a little breathing space in which questions oriented towards critical thinking have time to come to mind. 

When you are gathering information, don't engage with bugs, stay focused on your objective and savor it. Let each objective breathe, if you notice some behavior of interest take note and move on.

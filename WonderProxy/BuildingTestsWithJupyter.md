With the test case we want to automate in mind, 



##Step through your test
Note teh high level steps
Block them out in cells
start rough automation
consolidate cells
externalize behavior into methods


## Take a Tour
The first thing to do is step through the test that you want to automate. At this point its not about searching for locators or considering edge cases, it's just about being familiar with the flow of actions and pages for the test case. 

In this case we will be using [OrangeHRM](https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com) an open source human resource management tool. [explain test here]

## Creating An Outline
Now that we have built up a mental model for the test, before jumping into writing test code, we'll create a new notebook and start to document the flow of the test.

Jupyter Notebooks are a mixed media experience. Rather than code comments, we will use markdown `cells` to document the rough outline of the test. This allows for headings, links and images in addition to plain text to be used. 

The first cell will hold a *title*  and *description* for the test.  Set the cell type to `markdown` by clicking the dropdown selector and choosing it in the dropdown menu.

## Adding the Code

It can be tempting to put all the code for a test case inside a single cell. Then the entire test can be executed by just clicking `run`. 

Instead additively iterate through the test

### Consolidate

### Refactor

## Documentation and Execution

## Using a Template
Like having a `readme` in your repos, you can have template notebooks that outline standards, requirements, or format

## DevOps is Different

## It's Not About the Pipeline

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment are important in dev ops, but once your pipeline is established and verified it just becomes part of the scenery. It's a feature that probably shipped months or even years ago. At most some type of regression testing of it may come up but its not really something at the forefront of a testers mind in dev ops.

What fundamentally changes testing is dev ops is the rate of change. Projects using waterfall often have a release cycles measured in months (some even years). Agile and scrum revolutionized so much in software by being able to ship at the end of each sprint, generating a release cadence generally measured in weeks. Dev ops often has automated deployments scheduled multiple times per day. This means the rate of change to production code can be *orders of magnitude* faster in dev ops than agile. 

It may be called a pipeline but it kind of turns into a freeway for deploying code. 

## Speed

Agile fundamentally changed testing, while a whole host of factors went into it at some level the sheer need for *speed* eroded many of the divides of old. The hard truth is generally teams can't ship software every week or two with siloed information and highly bureaucratic processes. Testers and testing doesn't really have any viable option but [shift left]().

If you accept that the pace change from waterfall to agile incited a wild fire of process and professional change in testing, then dev ops presents a similar scale need for change. 

We are treating it with the same magic bullet solution... Automation

Dev often see the solution to problems as just more code. 

Risk getting onto the freeway => merging
Parking code is dangerous too.

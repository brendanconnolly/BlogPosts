## Test Ambiguity 
One of the primary contributions a tester really brings is diversity of perspective. Testers by nature question assumptions and are often the first consumers of applications and features and tasked with modeling and understanding the drivers, motivations and behavior of users. It's like being a dedicated [focus group]() for your team. 

This set of skills gets misattributed to the testers mindset.  Our primary motivations are not f. [more about questioning motivations]

Testers are driven by a yearning to understand. It's not about finding bugs or new and interesting ways breaking things either. The primary motivation isn't the tests or testing. Testing simply acts as a medium for learning, a gateway for building undserstanding. As we explore we deepen our understanding of the application, its behavior,  architecture, limitations. This understanding is the foundation we build tests around.

The problem is we often conflate applying this understanding and motivation with testing. Being a tester doesn't mean everything you do is testing, or even worse QA-ing. The more this line of thinking is encouraged, the easier it becomes to marginalize the contributions and skills testers possess. 

It's definitely true that there are things that can be tested throughout the DevOps cycle. Not all places in that cycle have active or reoccurring testing. There is a difference between testing monitoring and ensuring we have quality metrics being caaptured. There is a difference between testing a design and helping to shape a better design. There is a differnece between a tester helping shape and groom and offering insight in the planning process with testing the planning process. 

What often happens is we label things with `test` that really aren't testing activities, instead it acts as a proxy to indicate or announce that yes, a tester can contribute here.

## Implied Ownership

Testers are often [pidgeon holed]() on their teams. It's pretty common for other roles on your team to not fully understand what a tester does.  Since there isn't a deep understanding of the testers role, when people see the word `test` they often mentally map that action onto a role. Test tasks are the realm of the testers and QA people. 
By saying we can test here, we are saying our skills apply here, we are interested in knowing more about this,  include us. This false labelling contributes to misunderstanding testers and testing inhibiting our access to activities that are really areas where our experience identifying risk, understanding our customers and deep product knowledge can contribute to quality outcomes. 


## Quality Evangelism

As we reduce our dependance on `test` as a requirement for our contributions we open ourselves to greater impact. 
We have to [let go of testing]() and [open source our mindset]() rather than say testing is everywhere. 

Quality matters at each point, so testers can step into a leadership role because quality has been our primary focus.

There's no more statements like `We aren't ready for testing yet` because we arent testing, we are instead actively evangelizing quality throughout the DevOps cycle. Drawing attention to potential quality risks by asking questions like: 

> How are WE Assuring Quality here?

> Does our Test Strategy enable the quality our customers expect?

> Is our pace a quality risk?

> Are we measuring quality here?

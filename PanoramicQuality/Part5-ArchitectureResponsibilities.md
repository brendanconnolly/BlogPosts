Its easy to overlook your architecture
architecture of software

## Know

### Topology
-Environments
Part of architecture is the environments where software is run.
Stages vary, what is different between Dev's Desk -> Test /Staging -> Production. The most obvious difference is *data* in both volume and variety, probably followed by *load*. That's just

### Technology
Buzzword or because its good
### Seams
recognizing seams
seams are often dividing lines between developers. developers may focus on the technology in their component, but the interplay of technology across the product is important for testers. 

Seams are borders for risk.

### Data Flow

geography vs geology vs topology
geology is about going beneath the surface



monitoring / dashboards / metrics => quantifying the knowledge you have about the architecture so it can be recorded and visualized

## Verify
testing to make sure that metrics are being accurately measured. Are you measuring the right things.
Are there things you thought you might need but don't. 

Knowing, and protecting created an information strategy, this step is where we start to validate that strategy and its implementation. 


### Impact
coupling,  is your code impacted? If/ when 3rd parties go a wry. 


Is it giving us what we need? Are we using it? Data is only good if you look at it. 
Monetary cost is just part of it, theres additional code complexity, additional dependencies, 

### Overload
Sometimes there are just too many solutions. If your logging is in one tool, exception reporting in another, infrastructure monitoring in another, application monitoring in yet one more, it can all get overwhelming. 

Just keeping your credentials straight is a challenge in that situation. Insights and


## Observability
Monitoring implies that you know what you are watching/looking for.

> Instead,we need to strengthen the human element,the curiosity element,the ability to make connections. We need to give people with those skills superpowers,extend their senses,support their intuitions and make it quick and easy to explore a hypothesis, disprove it,and move on to the real root cause.

Observability Driven Development -> Observability Driven(Enabled) Testing
Test to understand not just what users are doing (in a business sense, and in product sense) so understand why 

measurements vs observations
measurements are a series of facts 
observations context theory backed facts

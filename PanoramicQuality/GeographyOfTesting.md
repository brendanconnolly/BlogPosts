# Geography of Testing
DevOps drastically changes the landscape of testing. Collaboration between operations and development teams enables a steady stream of small changes to be deployed to production. This pace of change puts a real strain on traditional testing activities. There used to be a sense of safety in dedicating hours or even days to testing after code is complete and before release, yet this is a luxury and liability in DevOps. The more time that elapses from when code is written to when it is deployed, the more risk is actually introduced. The geography of production code is in a constant state of change, so the longer testing takes the more the landscape around and even beneath you changes, and the more risk it accrues. 

This rapid rate of change requires testers to broaden their vision, and shift the focus and geography of their actions.

For software testers this is about understanding the relationship between the code, infrastructure and external services of the application under test.

## Behavior Over Bugs

Testing new feature functionality can be an adventure. There may be clear cut expectations about how things *should* work, but its not unusual for testers to establish and work with developers and product team to define / refine the workflow. At the same time testers are attempting to stress the software an uncover and shake out bugs. 

Regression testing isn't a no holds barred bug hunt, we are trying to spot anomolies. Unexpected behavior in areas that that are either thought to be unrelated or functionally equivalent to the existing release version. As time and new releases and employees pass by different testers are going to be tasked with regression testing existing functionality. It's very easy to fall into attempting to blaze a trail retesting what has already been done, only now its weeks, months, years out of peoples minds.

### Why not focus on bugs
The problem here is even if you uncover gaps in previous testing efforts there may not be time or interest in resolving newly uncovered issues. You might be asking why a business wouldn't want to address these issues, or why a previous tester didn't catch these bugs. Before you count yourself an expert, consider that customers have not reported these issues. 

If you aren't already familiar with the area that you are regression testing it may be worth starting your regression testing on your current release before you dive into the new release. If you start seeing issues in current release, pump your brakes, take notes of what you are seeing then re-evaluate you approach. Don't let existing bugs block progress, any bugs you find right now are mostly likely just distractions during release time.  

New bugs in existing code just mean more time spent investigating functionality that may only tangentially be related to release. It's not that they may not be real bugs but at this point they are out in the field and it takes time to confirm reproduction steps, log the bug, etc.

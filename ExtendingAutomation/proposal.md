Extending Your Automation: Introducing Jupyter Notebooks into your automation strategy


What if we could take existing page objects and other parts of our automation frameworks that you've put so much effort into  and utilize them not just for automated tests but through out the spectrum of testing.



By introducing Jupyter notebooks into your test automation strategy you can. Jupyter Notebooks allow you to blend descriptive content with executable code. Leveraging this power and flexibility you can extend our automation use into the day to day activities of testers, supporting quality and reducing the pain of repetive tasks.

In this workshop we'll take an exisiting automation framework with page objects and an api client and set of tests and introduce Jupyter Notebooks into the solution. Learning hands on we'll take the existing page objects and api client code and introduce them into Jupyter Notebooks to build:

- Playbooks for complex testing scenarios
- Semi automated tests to allow human interaction to be mixed with automated actions.
- Interactive Playbooks for training, onboarding or regression testing
- Templates for Exploratory Testing that capture screenshots and actions for reporting.

Learning outcomes:

    An understanding of what Jupyter Notebooks are.
    How notebooks can extend the return on investment of you automation framework
    How notebooks can support injecting automation into traditionally manual processes.

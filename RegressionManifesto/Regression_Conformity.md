Part 4 of a series of Core values for Regression Testing

## What is Conformity
> to act in accordance with prevailing standards or customs 

A second definition brings us closer to showing the holistic value testers can help bring to software

> bring into harmony or accord
 
As software is released we naturally develop both explicit and implicit contracts with customers. These contracts include the functional and non functional requirements of the system.  As testers part of our responsibilities lie in helping to ensure release to release that the contracts are not inadvertently altered or violated. 


## What is Complexity
> The state or quality of being intricate or complicated.

> a whole made up of complicated or interrelated parts

Testing is a complex activity involving arranging software into different states in attempts to discover potential issues. However there is a constant push and pull between what is considered a reasonable test and what is not. At any point in development lifecycle, an issues complexity can cause it to be dismissed as outlandish attempts by testers to draw out bugs. 

Theres an inverse relationship between the number of steps, or complexity of input required to reproduce an issue and the likelihood that it will be prioritized for fixing. 

## Uphold the Softwares Social Contract

Regression testing is a time for verifying that the norms established in existing functionality are unchanged. 

Updates and changes can be functioning as designed but still violate the expectations customers have developed over time. Software



When exploratory testing, when you encounter an issue how much time do you spend unwinding your actions? Attempting to distill the steps you took into the purest form.  

the path to discovery is a winding, then we begin the path back and the process of quantifying and indentification.

The hunt, the search these things are exciting. We want to be clinical, surgical and precise when regression testing. 

## Scheduled Maintenance

When you take your car into the shop 
Need it done in the most reasonable amount of time possible
Only do whats required
Then only really make sure that the rest of the car is operating within acceptable tolerances. 

Beyond that don't you get concerned about what the mechanic is telling you? It's outside of the context of your expectations, things seemed to be working fine before, why suddenly are all these things wrong?

Even if the information is valid you aren't really open to hearing it. In fact, it may cause you to question the quality of both previous work, and the current information.

## Multi-Point Quality Inspection

How do you fight this discovery bias

Part 4 of a series of Core values for Regression Testing

## What is Conformity
> to act in accordance with prevailing standards or customs 

A second definition brings us closer to showing the holistic value testers can help bring to software

> bring into harmony or accord
 
As software is released we naturally develop both explicit and implicit contracts with customers. These contracts include the functional and non functional requirements of the system.  As testers part of our responsibilities lie in helping to ensure release to release that the contracts are not inadvertently altered or violated. 


## What is Complexity
> The state or quality of being intricate or complicated.

> a whole made up of complicated or interrelated parts

Testing is a complex activity involving arranging software into different states in attempts to discover potential issues. However there is a constant push and pull between what is considered a reasonable test and what is not. At any point in development life cycle, an issues complexity can cause it to be dismissed as outlandish attempts by testers to draw out bugs. 

Theres an inverse relationship between the number of steps, or complexity of input required to reproduce an issue and the likelihood that it will be prioritized for fixing. 

## Scheduled Maintenance

Consider your motivations when you take your car into the shop for maintenance. You probably want it done in the most reasonable amount of time and the technicians to only do whats required. Outside of the required work, you only really care to be sure that the rest of the car is operating within acceptable tolerances. 

Beyond that don't you get concerned about what the mechanic is telling you? Things seemed to be working fine before, why suddenly are these things wrong? It simply raises a slew of undesirable considerations. Is the work neccessary? Is the car still safe? How Long will it take? What if they find something else? How much will all this cost? 

Even if the information is valid you aren't really open to hearing it. In fact, it may cause you to question the quality of both previous work, and the current information.

When changes are requested that are outside of the context of expectations, uncertainty rises. Since one set of expectations has been violated, it's easy to set off a chain reaction of fear. In the face of fear, people turn to blame to provide a sense comfort. 

No one would take their car to mechanic if they knew with certainty the car would function perfectly without it?

Similarly management sees regression testing as a just in case activity. Bugs are not expected but its not worth the risk of skipping it entirely. 

Any issues raised during regression testing will trigger the same fears you get with bad news from the mechanic about your car. There is now risk and uncertainty where we expected none. How did this happen? Should we fix this? Why didn't we catch this sooner?How does this impact schedule? Quality overall comes into question.

How do you fight this reaction?

## Multi-Point Quality Inspection

Bundled in with most cars scheduled maintenance is some form of multi-point vehicle inspection. Opportunity for selling additional services aside,this inspection provides a context for potential issues that are found. Its not some mechanic looking for opportunity, it's part of a standardized information driven review process.

Inspection checks are not about new tests. They aren't evaluating the design of parts. They aren't introducing additional or new stressors on components. Inspections are measurements of how the subject being evaluated conforms to existing standards.

Modeling regression testing as a quality inspection helps set expectations to avoid the blame cycle that can arise when bugs are  found at unexpected times. 






## Uphold the Social Contract

Regression testing is a time for verifying that the norms established in existing functionality remain unchanged. 

Updates and changes can be functioning as designed but still violate the expectations customers have developed over time. Software



In exploratory testing, when you encounter an issue how much time do you spend unwinding your actions? Attempting to distill the steps you took into the purest form so you can report your findings.  



the path to discovery is a winding, then we begin the path back and the process of quantifying and indentification.

The hunt, the search these things are exciting. We want to be clinical, surgical and precise when regression testing.

### Why does Consistency matter?
Consistent software behavior is what keeps our customers comfortable. Think of it like renting a car, you know how to drive, but the moment you step into that rental you immediately start trying to acclimate yourself to a sea of changes compared to your own car. The process can be frustrating, but at least its expected. 

When your software changes, your customers go through that same process. Instead of it being expected like when stepping into a rental car, it's their daily driver. 

If this change is by design it's explicit and intentionally included so it should be covered in regular feature testing not caught in a regression sweep.  

### Example changing a hotkey to follow a convention. 

### While feature testing this is benchmark is design/ convention / specification

### While regression testing the benchmark is production

changes in consistency will result in customer questions

regression is about evaluating/ investigating unintended changes to current behavior.


### Example change in financial calculation


Changes in consistency require more than just verification. Customer expections need to be managed. 


### Example changing gears / transmissions 
Manual or Automatic across the car industry you see the same indicators for gears. Even when they many not exactly be in line with the underlying technology in the car. In ht erare occurences when a car does not have traditional gear markers isnt the first reaction shock and curiousity? Followed by confusion, what does this do and why is it different.

## Regression is like the mission statement of your product. 
General isn't vague, it's about having core understanding of users needs that people can grasp and uphold. Regression is about ensuring that service legacy is upheld in the face of new changes.

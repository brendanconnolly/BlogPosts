The days of the segregated testing departments have largely gone, or at least for many of us faded from our collective memories. The idea of sanctity via wholly separate organizations has transitioned to embedding an outsiders mindset onto agile teams. 

Some groups can afford to have their own languages, vocabulary, or acronyms and reasonably expect other teams and roles to learn or understand them in order to communicate with them effectively. When it comes to teams, the working vocabulary is typically determined and framed by either influence or authority. This is visible in the transition of teams from waterfall to agile software development. Initially as an influential group of people united under the umbrella of the agile manifesto and demonstrated increased success delivering software. Later via authority as management teams began more forcefully transitioning existing traditionally waterfall teams into agile methodologies. 

Traditionally testers as a collective group have had neither the influence or authority to dictate the process or vocabulary of their teams. This leaves testers constantly in a position of needing to demonstrate value before advocating for a new practice or process. The challenge in testing is facilitating quality without the luxury of a role or title that implicitly grants influence or authority. 

Roles and titles aren't the only things that carry the influence and authority to affect change. Instead of trying to impose a test or QA centric view on teams from a position of relative weakness, borrow the power and influence already granted by team members by leveraging existing practices or concepts from their domain. 

There are three C's that can guide you through this rebranding and repackaging process. 

The first C is *Comprehend*, and honestly this step should feel natural to testers. Good testing is always about seeking understanding. The product team usually provides the 'what' of a feature, the developers implement the 'how', and both those things are important but a testers focus is the *why*. The 'why' is about understanding the relevance of the change, and it reaches beyond a single role. Why is this feature important to users? Why did the developer implement it this way? Why did the product manager want it this way? 

It's about a holistic understanding. So before we can sneak testing into a conversation we need to know the audience, look for an analogous practice and understand its principles and benefits.

With the reconnaissance complete, the next step is to *Co-Opt* that practice and map our testing centric process onto it. This might sound intimidating or maybe even a little subversive, but it's not a new concept. People are constantly taking "inspiration" from other things. 

Automated testing is something testers constantly hear about or work with. That concept did not originate in the software world, in fact it's just one of many software development practices that have been heavily influenced by manufacturing processes. Someone simply took a working example from a different domain and used the power of an accepted practice and working example to increase chances it would be adopted. Rather than come up with a whole new vocabulary and then try to explain the terms, the concept and why it will work, they can just say it's like putting a robot on the assembly line and leverage existing credibility. 

Which leads to the last step, *Communicate*, simply use this common language to engage with your team. This, much like the first C, *Comprehend*, is a major skill testers already have. Testers are constantly translating between Testers are constantly translating between technical, product, domain and industry concepts to disparate groups.  
 
As a real world type example, consider a you're on a team where testers write test cases while a feature is being developed and those tests are executed upon codes completion. You hate the test cases because they fall out of date quickly they rarely match what you actually test. 

Comprehend: Documenting test cases is usually about providing something that can be reviewed, either when things go wrong, or for training etc. An analogous practice in development might be code review. 

By understanding code review, we see that developers review work a pieces are completed. There may be some upfront design discussion to serve as a strategy, but they aren't documenting what they might do. Code review also isn't about just catching bugs, its a chance to converse and share information and standards. It's about enabling other people to work in that area comfortably. Also the comments and changes are often stored alongside the code for future review etc. 

Co-Opt: Now apply that to our testing problem. A test review process modeled after the teams code review process, can allow testers to document their test activities after testing a feature. This could then be discussed or shared and linked to the user story for future reference. 

Communicate: Now we have language and process to support a change. What might have been misconstrued as complaining now has an actionable solution. 

Beyond addressing the immediate issue, we now have a deeper understanding that grants more insight. It's one less wall between roles, that insight can enable deeper and more effective communication granting testers even greater influence over quality.

The days of the segregated testing departments have largely gone, or at least for many of us faded from our collective memories. The idea of sanctity via wholly separate organizations has transitioned to embedding an outsiders mindset onto agile teams. 

While testers may no longer face the same struggle to be included early in design discussions, the shift left has broadened the responsibilities and skillset expected of testers. On any given day, testers could be communicating with product managers, developers, the support team, or directly with customers. 

Some groups can afford to have their own languages, vocabulary, or acronyms and reasonably expect other teams and roles to learn or understand them in order to communicate with them effectively. When it comes to teams, the working vocabulary is typically determined and framed by either authority or majority. In software development this likely means the words the teams use are heavily influenced by developers.

While the shift left for testers has been a very positive change, the transition has lead testers into a more advisory role. The value of a tester is in their ability to enable quality. Part of this new role is actual testing, but the real power comes from a testers ability to influence, to coach quality.

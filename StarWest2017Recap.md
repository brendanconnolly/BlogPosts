![STAR WEST 2017 Recap]()

After attending the STAR West 2017 conference this year, I wanted to take a little time to share some of my thoughts, takeaways and inspirations from the conference. 

STAR West is a pretty large conference and it felt big, lots of people, lots of vendors and lots of sessions. 

## Keynote: Rise of the Machines: Can Artificial Intelligence Terminate Manual Testing?

When I sat down and got ready for the opening keynote I wasn't sure what to expect. Machine Learning and AI in the software and testing worlds are major buzz words right now, so I wasn't surprised to see them at the forefront of the conference. Largely uninformed and entirely skeptical I have been dismissing machine learning completely so I admit I cringe when I see talks about it and expect hype, fear and smoke and mirrors. 

So when Tariq King hit the stage I was skeptical, however he opened with this montage of pretty much every sci-fi movie representation of artificial intelligence there is all nicely edited amd mixed with music. It was slick and polished, I sat thinking this is the big leagues of keynote speaking. 

Tariq also brought forth a challenge to push testing forward through innovation. To paraphrase he stated that testing as an industry has in many ways been falling behind, he even has #bringbacktesting. This really resonated with me, ironically for some of the same reasons I resisted machine learning. It's just the latest thing that will be the death to testers. 

What I particularly appreciated from the keynote was the recognition that there are differences between machines and humans and they each have benefits. This reconciles quite nicely with my views on automated testing.

#### Highlights

This was one of the most polished keynotes I've seen, I left with very high expectations for the rest of the conference.

## Keynote: Testing and DevOps: Organizations and Their Culture Must Change

So the bar was set pretty high for the second keynote, but it was a very different type of talk. It felt like a successful experience report of a teams transition to DevOps. There was a nice focus on the need of philosophical changes for teams to transition to newer ways of doing things, focusing on DevOps being a extension of an Agile transition. 

There some good stuff:
- including regression testing into current sprints instead of a release / hardening sprint
- enable testers involvement early and in a manufacturing sense allow them to *Halt* the line.
- include automation early as a collaborative effort to increase alignment
- the importance of test data

Unfortunately when time came to discuss how testers roles change in DevOps, the talk fell to the very expected topic of increasing technical skills of testers. It's not that I don't understand or recognize this shift, but I think testers have heard this before. I would have like to see more depth and insight here, there are some very highly functioning Agile / DevOps teams that value exploratory testers. I think the audience would have benefitted from hearing how those teams have changed.

## Get Involved Early: A Tester’s Experience with Requirements

I really enjoyed this experience report by Julie Lebo. Good requirements have been a challenge on many projects I have worked on. Her journey as a solo tester was really informative, she discussed going back to school to get her masters degree in computer science. I am interested in computer science but I have read mixed things about the value of masters level computer science considering it can often be very theoretical in nature. It was great to hear a tester talk about her thesis and the value it brought her as a tester.

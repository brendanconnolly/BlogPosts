In this second installment of Testing the Arbitrary we'll take a look at testing a vending machine and create a mind map to record the results. If you are not familiar with mind maps you can take a look at my post [Mind Mapping a Stapler]() for more details. 

Similar to a stapler, testing a vending machine is another one of random items you might get asked to come up with tests for in an interview.  I think its safe to say at one point or another we've all used a vending machine, but have you ever thought about all the components you would test? It's actually a pretty rich surface for testers to use as a thought experiment. 

### Setting Scope
Just saying vending machine is vague, so what kind of vending machine is it? While its not specifically about the good inside the machine it does affect the tests that need to be performed. 

It might sound like a soda vs snacks question, but its more about does the vending machine sell all items at a single price or do prices vary by the item selected.

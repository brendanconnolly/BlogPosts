Whether it's making the latest release deadline or just being generally productive, time management is hard.  

I found the time for this blog by following some [advice from John Sonmez](https://twitter.com/jsonmez/status/659052192045862912) and paying myself first by waking up an  hour earlier than usual to dedicate time for the project. I'm not a morning person so this suggestion was an affront to my natural sensibilities. So I figured I'll just squeeze in time in the evenings. 

It just didn't work, by the time I finished work, got home for dinner and spent some time with family I was just not in a state that lead to anything productive. You can add on some general exhaustion from having a child in the home that sometimes likes to wake up in the middle of the night and you can imagine just how little was getting done. 

It turned out the best time was actually the early morning. I was mostly rested and had energy to allow me to focus. It was actually pretty nice since the house was quiet and I was alone to get some work done. 

### Competing Interests

That strategy has served me pretty well, but its not a silver bullet. Its pretty tough to scale that approach. I have a side project on Github that I'm trying to get momentum on, I [started a local testers meetup group](), a morning exercise ritual... I've contemplated waking up another hour earlier but I just haven't succeeded in actually doing it. Even then there's only so many hours in the day.

The only option with multiple interests is to do more with the time thats available. 

### Charters and Priority

Just getting started is the hardest part. I talk about friction a lot, any thing that might impede my progress real or percieved is likely going to cause delayed progress (and act like a pebble in my shoe until the task is done). Joel Spolsky from Joel On Software has a really nice article about the impact of these [tiny frustrations](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/uibook/chapters/fog0000000057.html) on user experience.

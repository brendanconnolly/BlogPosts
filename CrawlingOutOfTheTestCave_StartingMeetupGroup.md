The teting community is great. I got hooked in after watching the live stream of the [CAST]() Conference.

### Phase 1: The Search

I wanted the same feeling of community I experienced online only locally. I work in a relatively small city but for its size we have a quite a bit of software being developed here, we even have early claims to the title [Silicon Beach](http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9807/20/beach.idg/index.html?_s=PM:TECH). Although that title has stuck more to the Santa Monica area we still find our way into the [News](http://www.independent.com/news/2015/nov/05/tech-topia/). 

So I just assumed that when I would search for a [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com) that there would be a group... There wasn't.  
I expanded the search thinking there had to be one. In 20 miles, in 50 miles nope. I finally got hits at the 100 mile mark, and frankly looking at them I was jealous, on top of the general test groups there were more focused ones on automation and tooling. 

I ended up joined a few of the local development oriented groups to see how things went, but I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed.

as we shift left testing becomes a specialist rather than generalist role
there are generally less specialists on a project. which is why you need to niche down or broaden skills.

When I started in testing, the test team was completely separate from the development team. It wasn't that we couldn't speak to developers, it was more about maintaining a separation from the corrupting influence of the developers and their management. Like [West Side Story](), it was a relatively jovial relationship so long as everybody stuck to their own turf.

There just isn't the time for Sharks versus Jets style interactions. The relationship between testers and developers will inherently have some tension, but it doesn't have to be the foundation of the relationship. 

### Position vs. Role
As the industry shifts left and quality and testability are getting more attention earlier in the development cycle, testing is cast in a different light. When testing became the responsibility of the whole team, the make up of the team also changed. No longer is there a guaranteed software tester or QA person on a team. That position in many organizations is gone, it's not that the work of the tester isn't being done it's now become a role shared across the team.

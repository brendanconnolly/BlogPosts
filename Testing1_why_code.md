Testing: Why this Tester Learned to Code
========================================

Where I first started testing, it was essentially all manual testers. Much of the work fell into 
what James Bach and Michael Bolton would refer to as checks rather than tests.<cite>[1]</cite> The team was the quality guardian.
The last line of defense before software could be released onto the world. The relationship between QA and Development
was rocky at best. What automated checking existed was brittle, out of date, and difficult to maintain. Tools were
limited and getting developer time to build anything for QA was a fools errand. There was constant pressure to release faster.

It wasn't all bad, in fact there was a lot of good. The main problem was theever increasing burden of manual checking that grew 
with every feature that was added. Often these checks were repitive, tedious and hard. It took time away from actual testing.

 In my heart I am a *lazy* tester in the Larry Wall sense of the word.<cite>[2]</cite> If I was confronted by a relatively mindless
 (read as: repitive, tedious and hard) task I was looking for some way to make the computer do the work for me or at least do the heavy lifting. 
 I did what I could with batch files and scripts but some cases just needed different tools. I knew I needed code. 
 
 I had always wanted to program. I grew up on 80's 8bit video games and dreaming of writing my own. Some of my early exposure was looking at C and 
 being a little scared off. [metroid code] So I was uncertain of my success but I knew I had to try. I wasn't looking to jump from QA to development.
 I was looking to use development skills to improve my testing.

If you aren't familiar, [Mind Maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map) are diagrams used to visually organize information. You may recognize them from brainstorming activities you have done in school. That was my first exposure, as part of learning to write essays we started out by brainstorming ideas. We'd put a cloud in the center of our page and in it place the topic of the project then jot our ideas and their relationships down.

### Why A Stapler
A common question in tester interviews is "How would you test 'X'?" Sometimes its software related, like how would test a simple search page similar to googles. Other times its not really got anything to do with software, it seems to be inspired by whatever the interviewer might have on their desk like pens and staplers.

It's a bit of a challenge for me because my first reaction to these types of questions is just to draw a blank. It's not that I can't think of test cases, its more that I need a little time to get started, so I usually start with a little exploring to get the test juices flowing. That's great and all but as a tester we need to be able to effectively communicate our ideas and process as well as [perform on demand](http://www.satisfice.com/blog/archives/1346). It's also a matter of [practice](http://www.satisfice.com/blog/archives/958), sharpening general testing skills helps to eliminate that initial pause when being presented with something completely random to test.

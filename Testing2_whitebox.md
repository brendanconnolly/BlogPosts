Pair and Peek

Once I started to code, I was always peeking at other peoples work especially the code I was going to tbe testing.
I was self conscious about how my own code looked, so I looked at other peoples to get a better understanding. Soon 
I got in the habit of reviewing every bug fix and feature that I was assigned to test. 

First I'd read the user story or bug report. Then I would begin modeling in my head the behavior I expected to see,
the personas and scenarios I would need for testing. With that model in mind, I could clarify things with the owner
if neccessary then I would jump into looking at the changes that were checked in. 

It wasn't always easy, the project at the time used three different languages (c++, c# and vb6) and spanned two source
control systems. The test team worked closely with development but this wasn't standard practice.

What it caused was a dialog. It provided context.

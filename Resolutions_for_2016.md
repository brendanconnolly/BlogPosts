![2016 Resolutions](http://www.brendanconnolly.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/2016-new-years-resolutions.jpg)

As 2015 comes to a close, it's time to start setting goals and laying out plans for 2016. Before I go into my resolutions as a tester for 2016, I wanted to express my thanks to the brave readers of this blog. 

Without further ado, this testers New Years Resolutions...   

### Linux and the Cloud
If it's not already here for you, Linux and cloud computing are major areas for testers to get familiar with. 

I see testers being more and more involved in deployment and to keep my skills up I plan on going through the [AWS Training](https://aws.amazon.com/training/) and I'm checking out their certifications are worth pursuing just to show proof of familiarity. 

Linux goes hand in had with the push to the cloud.  I don't think testers have to be Linux gurus but we need to be proficient on it and at least unintimidated by the command line. I found a class at my local community college to offer some structured learning at a really reasonable price.

### Test Plan Alternatives
You may have seen my post on [Test Case Pain](http://www.brendanconnolly.net/test-case-pains/), and I want to push the #NoTestPlans movement inspired by the #NoEstimates movement. 

It's easy to criticize, I'd like to present a practical light-weight, tester-friendly alternative to detailed, prescriptive test documentation. 

### Session Based Testing
From what I've read so far [Session Based Test Management](http://www.satisfice.com/sbtm/) or something inspired by it will play a key part in replacing the test plan. I love that it allows testers freedom and provides management some visibility into the process. 

I haven't used this process before so in the new year I'll be researching and practicing.  

### BBST

I really enjoyed taking the [BBST Foundations Course](http://www.brendanconnolly.net/bbst-foundations-week-1-in-review/) this year. It was great to collaborate with other testers and improve my craft. 

I haven't decided whether it will be [Bug Advocacy](http://www.associationforsoftwaretesting.org/training-2/courses/bug-advocacy/) or [Test Design](http://www.associationforsoftwaretesting.org/training-2/courses/test-design/) yet. I'm leaning towards Test Design but I'm confident either would be well worth the time investment. Maybe both time permitting, I wouldn't mind doing the instructor class at some point...

### Meetups and Conferences
So I started a local [testers meetup](http://www.brendanconnolly.net/out-of-the-test-cave-starting-a-meetup-group/) and gave a lightning talk at a JavaScript meetup. I want to engage more with both in the coming year. 

I'd also like to step outside my local community and attend a testing conference. I am really hoping to attend [CAST 2016](http://www.associationforsoftwaretesting.org/conference/cast-2016/) since the live stream of the 2015 version was great. Twitter and blogs are great but getting to meet and talk to a diverse group of testers looks amazing.

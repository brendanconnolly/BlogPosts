### Inner vs outer loop

I speak your language, I respect your processes and roles, I am not an outsider or a threat.

Code Quality / Test Quality

if quality code matters what about test quality? 

### Why do Code Reviews?

The obvious hope for bug catches

The real impact is it changes behavior when writing the code. You know it will be discussed immediately not potentially.

Knowledge transfer and more familiarity with different areas of the code.
Its an opportunity for conversation about choices being made.

substance over style, we don't want to get caught in  style holy wars

Done well, it's quick and painless. Its not personal it may not even be in person. 


### Test Reviews?
Do you, or your testers discuss the testing that been done? There's often an association of heavy overhead with dedicated manual testers from the legacy of bureaucratic waterfall projects. These monolithic test plans and test cases are created, reviewed and then stored for the ages.

Many have a similar view of code review. It's senseless bureaucracy, that slows everyone down, gets in the way of real productivity and at worst devolves into semantic bludgeoning. 

The usual response to those critiques is "you're doing it wrong then". We should all be familiar with that as it's a common refrain when agile process is discussed. 

If we can acknowledge that there is value in a well implemented code review strategy, then there is no reason that testing cannot benefit from the same treatment with the same expected benefits.

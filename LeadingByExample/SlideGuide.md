shared process+vocabulary = better collaboration

Messages are always easier to receive when they are in a language you can understand.
Regardless of role the better your communication and collaboration, the higher level of influence you have. This builds credibility, trust and along with that the ability to drive change from any position.

Acceptance of new ideas is always easier when there is a functioning local example.
Even co-opted versions can serve as the model of success.

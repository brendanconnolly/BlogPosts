Test Driven Development is process to help steer developers towards creating better code by using a test first approach to writing code. There are [three simple laws](http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/The_Three_Laws_of_Test-Driven_Development):

    1. You can't write any production code until you have first written a failing unit test.
    2. You can't write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail, and not compiling is failing.
    3. You can't write more production code than is sufficient to pass the currently failing unit test.  
    
It starts with an expectation, this can be about desired behavior but it also includes things like internal structures and implementation. What this means is generally the first step after writing a test is writing just enough code to allow the test to actually compile and be run. The result is a tight feedback loop of expectation, implementation, verification that is referred to as the Red Green Refactor 
Unit tests are used as a blueprint for the production code. 


#### Unit Testing Vs. TDD
Developers writing unit tests may not be doing TDD. Developers doing TDD are writing unit tests. This may seem a little subtle, but a test first approach over a tests exist approach allows design to evolve before a project is completed. There is an introspective side to TDD since the developer is forced to consume the code they are writing before it is fully complete. Refactoring is expected in TDD, in other approaches developers may be less likely to introduce change because...


### Test Driven Testing
TDD may not be practiced by all teams, in some circles it may even be controversial or potentially detrimental but across the developer community the process is generally known and accepted even if not implemented.
Take developer's unit tests out of the equation and think about testing performed dedicated testers. Are there canonical, generally accepted approaches to doing good testing? 

Lets coopt the development concept and rebrand...
